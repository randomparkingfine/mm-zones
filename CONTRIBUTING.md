Any and all types of maps are welcome of course, if for some reason people want the maps categorized then it can be ararnged easily.

> What's a stage and what isn't?

If the mapper of a map in question has any say about it go with whatever they say.
That being said there are thousands of maps and without theory-jerking here are some go to principles I use in no particular order:

* Teleports from one area to another

* Labeled stages. 

	Tons of maps are """linear""" in the surf but also in that there are no real teleports from one stage to another like `bhop_fps_max_sr`.

	Maps like this also have a stage number written on the ground so I try to setup the stage boundary in such a way that it's basically impossible to _not_ hit the stage trigger.

* Art changes

	If there's a room color change or _drastic_ art style change from one room to another.

	These are more picky to judge because my only caveat with this is there has to be some kind of really obvious door or somthing seperating the two rooms.
