# Momentum-Mod Zones

For now all zones are found in the zones folder. 

Start zones are fixed so the exit speed is set to `290.0` velocity.

## Installing

Find your `steamapps/common/Momentum Mod/momentum/maps` and drop the _contents_ of this repo's `/maps` folder in there to update any previous maps and get whatever new maps you may need.

To do that just click on the download button(_the one with the cloud icon_) then just grab everything inside this maps folder and drop it directly into yours.
