# Momentum-Mod Zones

__Note__: Start zones are fixed so the exit speed is set to `290.0` velocity.

## Installing

I've split surf and bhop maps but just take the `.zon` files from which ever (_or both_) and drop them in:

```
\Path\To\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Momentum Mod\momentum\maps
```

Check the [contributing guide](https://gitlab.com/shockrahwow/mm-zones/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for info on that.

I've also provided a zoning config file here which should make it easier to zone maps and get back to playing. It should leave movement binds alone so you can do everything like normal.
