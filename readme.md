# Momentum-Mod Zones

For now all zones are found in the zones folder. 

Start zones are fixed so the exit speed is set to `290.0` velocity.

## Installing

To make things easy check the [Tags page](https://gitlab.com/shockrahwow/mm-zones/tags) for the nightly set of zone files.

Then just drop the maps folder from the tag zip file into your `steamapps/common/Momentum Mod/momentum/maps` folder. 

## Contribute?!?!?!?
