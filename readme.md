# Momentum-Mod Zones

For now all zones are found in the zones folder. 

Start zones are fixed so the exit speed is set to `290.0` velocity.

## [Installing](https://gitlab.com/shockrahwow/mm-zones/tags)

To make things easy check the [Tags page](https://gitlab.com/shockrahwow/mm-zones/tags) for the nightly set of zone files.

Then just drop the maps folder from the tag zip file into your `steamapps/common/Momentum Mod/momentum/maps` folder. 

## [Contribute?!?!?!?](https://gitlab.com/shockrahwow/mm-zones/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Check the [contributing guide](https://gitlab.com/shockrahwow/mm-zones/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for info on that.

I've also provided a zoning config file here which should make it easier to zone maps and get back to playing. It should leave movement binds alone so you can do everything like normal.
