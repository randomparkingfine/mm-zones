# Momentum-Mod Zones

For now all zones are found in the zones folder. 

Start zones are fixed so the exit speed is set to `290.0` velocity.

## Installing

Find your `steamapps/common/Momentum Mod/momentum/maps` and drop the _contents_ of this repo's `/maps` folder in there to update any previous maps and get whatever new maps you may need.

## Contriubuting

If you have any zones you'd like publicly available you have a few options:

- Message me on discord: (гд\_д) shockrah#2647 
- Email me: alerah@protonmail.com
- DM me on steam
- Sumbit a pull request

Just know that zones should adhere to you're respective community's standards, whatever they might be
